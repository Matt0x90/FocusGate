# Chrome Web Store Listing for FocusGate

## Basic Information

**Extension Name:** FocusGate

**Short Description (132 characters max):**
Stay focused by blocking distracting sites with per-site permissions and one-tap snooze. Privacy-first: no tracking or data collection.

## Detailed Description

**FocusGate** helps you take control of your time online without sacrificing your privacy. Add distracting domains to your blocklist and FocusGate will quietly redirect visits to a friendly page explaining why the site is blocked. When you need a break, snooze all blocks or just one domain with a single click‚Äîthe extension automatically resumes when the timer expires. Everything runs locally in your browser with no analytics, no remote servers, and no blanket host access.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **üéØ Targeted Blocking** - Add domains like `twitter.com` or `reddit.com`. FocusGate requests permission only for that specific site, never for all your browsing.
- **üîí Privacy by Design** - Zero data collection. No analytics. No remote servers. Your blocklist stays on your device and syncs via Chrome if you're signed in.
- **‚è∏Ô∏è Smart Snooze** - Need a quick break? Pause all blocking for 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 12 hours. Or snooze just one site for 15 minutes. Timers persist across browser restarts.
- **üì§ Import/Export** - Backup your blocklist or share it between devices. Imports prompt for permission per site‚Äîyou stay in control.
- **üåì Dark Mode** - Automatically adapts to your system's dark/light preference for comfortable use any time.
- **‚ôø Accessible** - Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and high contrast design ensure everyone can stay focused.
- **üåç International** - Interface text is fully translatable. English included, with support for additional languages.

### üõ°Ô∏è How It Works

Unlike other blockers that request access to all your browsing data, FocusGate uses Chrome's Declarative Net Request API to redirect only the specific domains you block. When you visit a blocked site, you're redirected to a local page (not a server) that explains the block and offers snooze options.

### üîê Your Privacy Matters

FocusGate is built on a foundation of privacy:
- **No Data Collection** - We don't collect any user data, period.
- **No Network Requests** - The extension never contacts external servers.
- **No Content Scripts** - We don't inject code into the pages you visit.
- **Local Storage Only** - Your settings stay on your device (or sync via Chrome).
- **Open Source** - Review our code to verify our privacy claims.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Permissions Explained

We only request the minimum permissions needed:
- **declarativeNetRequest** - Redirects blocked sites to our local blocked page
- **storage** - Saves your blocklist and preferences locally
- **alarms** - Schedules automatic resume when snooze timers expire
- **Per-site host permissions** - Requested individually when you add each domain

Install FocusGate today to reclaim your attention and stop mindless scrolling‚Äîwithout giving up your privacy.

## Additional Information for Reviewers

### Single Purpose Description
FocusGate blocks distracting websites to help users stay focused, with temporary snooze options when access is needed.

### Permission Justifications

1. **declarativeNetRequest** - Required to redirect navigation from blocked domains to our local blocked.html page. We use this API specifically because it's more privacy-preserving than webRequest.

2. **storage** - Required to persist the user's blocklist and UI preferences. We use sync storage for the blocklist (so it follows users across devices) and local storage for temporary states like snooze timers.

3. **alarms** - Required to automatically resume blocking when snooze timers expire. Without this, users would have to manually resume blocking.

4. **optional_host_permissions (*://*/*)** - Declared as optional and NEVER requested in bulk. When a user adds a domain, we request permission for only that specific domain and its subdomains. Users can deny any individual permission request.

### Security & Privacy Notes for Reviewers

- **No Remote Code** - All JavaScript is bundled with the extension
- **No External Resources** - No CDNs, external scripts, or remote assets
- **Input Validation** - All user input is validated and sanitized
- **CSP Header** - Strict Content Security Policy in manifest.json
- **No eval()** - No dynamic code execution
- **No innerHTML** - Only safe DOM methods like textContent
